## Introduction

Budweiser provided our team with data and asked us to conduct a study on US craft beers and their breweries. In this document, we addressed questions that Budweiser had and reported any interesting findings.

## Data

The analysis uses two datasets:
- `Beers_updated_2.csv`: Contains information about different craft beers, including ABV, IBU, style, and more.
- `Breweries.csv`: Provides details about breweries, including their name and location.

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into several items, including:

1. Number of Breweries by State: A bar chart displaying the number of craft beer breweries in each US state
2. Merging Beer and Brewery Data: Merging beer data with brewery data to associate beers with their respective breweries
3. Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing values in the datasets and imputing missing IBU values
4. **Median ABV and IBU by State**: computing the median alcoholic content and bitterness for each US state and visualizing the results.
5. **Maximum ABV and IBU Beers**: Identifying the states with the maximum alcoholic (ABV) and most bitter (IBU) beers
6. **ABV Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of alcoholic content (ABV) in the dataset
7. Relationship between ABV and IBU: Investigating the relationship between the bitterness of beer and its alcoholic content
8. Comparison of IPAs and Other Ales: Exploring the Differences in ABV and IBU between India Pale Ales (IPAs) and Other Types of Ale

## Results

The results of the analysis are presented with visualizations and explanations, including the number of breweries by state, merged data samples, handling of missing values, and more. Notable findings include the states with the highest ABV and IBU beers, the distribution of ABV and IBU, and the relationship between these two factors.

## Additional Analysis

The repository also includes additional data analysis, such as the distribution of IBU, identifying k values for k-nearest neighbors analysis, and more.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides insights into the world of US craft beers, their characteristics, and their distribution across states. The findings are summarized in the R Markdown document.
